# 🔧 FetchWithAuth Issues - Fixed!

## ❌ Problem
The application was throwing errors in `fetchUserSubscription` and `fetchUserDesigns` functions:
- Functions were being called before user authentication was complete
- API requests were failing due to missing or invalid authentication tokens
- Services lacked proper health endpoints for monitoring

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Authentication State Management**
- **Updated Home Page**: Added proper authentication state checking using `useSession`
- **Conditional API Calls**: Only call `fetchUserSubscription` and `fetchUserDesigns` when user is authenticated
- **Session Validation**: Check for `status === "authenticated"` before making API requests

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Enhanced fetchWithAuth**: Better session validation and error messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Functions fail silently for unauthenticated users instead of throwing errors
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 3. **Service Health Monitoring**
- **Health Endpoints**: Added `/health` endpoints to all services:
  - API Gateway: `http://localhost:5000/health`
  - Design Service: `http://localhost:5001/health` 
  - Upload Service: `http://localhost:5002/health`
  - Subscription Service: `http://localhost:5003/health`

### 4. **Authentication Flow Fixes**
```javascript
// Before (causing errors):
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserSubscription(); // Called regardless of auth state
  fetchUserDesigns();     // Called regardless of auth state
}, []);

// After (fixed):
useEffect(() => {
  if (status === "authenticated" && session) {
    fetchUserSubscription(); // Only called when authenticated
    fetchUserDesigns();     // Only called when authenticated
  }
}, [status, session]);
```

## 🎯 Results
- ✅ No more `fetchWithAuth` errors on page load
- ✅ API calls only made when user is properly authenticated
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ Health endpoints for service monitoring
- ✅ Graceful handling of unauthenticated state

## 🚀 Current Status
All services are running and the authentication flow is working properly:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:5000 ✅  
- **All Microservices**: Running and healthy ✅

The application should now load without errors and only attempt to fetch user data when the user is properly logged in!
